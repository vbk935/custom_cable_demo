= Why isn’t SearchIQ working for my website? =
Assuming you have installed everything according the instructions, there could be two reasons you still can’t see SearchIQ working as planned:

1. Your site doesn’t have a search bar -  In this case, go to options tab in the SearchIQ plugin admin. You will see options to add a search bar as a widget or as an icon in your site’s menu.

2. If your site does have a search bar - The search box input element name could be something other than the default value of 's'. Inspect the search box element on your site and copy the name into the "Search box name" field found under the "Options" tab in SearchIQ plugin.
