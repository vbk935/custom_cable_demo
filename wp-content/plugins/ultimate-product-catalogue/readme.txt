** We are pleased to offer a free 7-day trial of the premium version of the product catalog, which you can use to test out premium features, such as WooCommerce product sync and custom fields, before buying! **

The Ultimate Product Catalog is also a great solution for those who are running affiliate stores, in which you link out to products for sale on other sites. With the ability to specify a unique link for each product (using the "Product Link" field), you can insert your affiliate link and then set it up so that, when someone clicks on a product in your catalog, they are brought to that link instead of the product page in the plugin. You get all the benefits and functionality of the Ultimate Product Catalog while being able to sell as an affiliate.

`[product-catalogue id="X"] or [product-catalog id="X"]
`

Simply insert either of the shortcodes above (replacing the "X" with the actual ID of your product catalog) to add a product catalog, with product filters, to any page.

Choose between six default responsive layouts for your product catalog, or use the Custom CSS features or any of the hundreds of styling options. Make your product catalog easy to browse, sort and update with advanced product filter options in your catalog sidebar as well as categories, sub-categories, tags and custom fields.

Perfect to create a product catalog for your store, art gallery, restaurant and more!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display my product catalog? If I have more than one product catalog, what do I do? =

Put the following product catalog shortcode on whatever page you’re trying to put the product catalog on: ‘[product-catalogue id=’X’]’ or [product-catalog id=’X’]. Replace the ‘X’ with the ID of your product catalog. This can be found by clicking on your product catalog. The product catalog ID  is beside the product catalog name on the product catalog’s details page. You can also copy the product catalog shortcode directly from the “Catalogues” page.

To display one of your product catalogs, use the corresponding attribute ‘id='X'’ in the product-catalogue shortcode to specify that product catalog, where 'X' is replaced with the product catalog ID.

= Can my products be in more than one category or sub-category? =

No, products can only be in a single category and sub-category. Products can have as many tags desired, since tags are used to represent product attributes, and only tags that are used for a product within a product catalog are displayed in the product catalog sidebar.

= Can I load my product catalog with a layout other than the default "Thumbnail" product catalog layout? =

Add the attribute starting_layout=‘LAYOUT’ for your product catalog, where LAYOUT is replaced with the layout you would like to be the starting product catalog layout (List or Detail are the two options currently).

= I only want to display one product catalog layout and to remove the layout bar at the top from my product catalog? =

The attribute ‘excluded_layouts’ lets you stop one or more layouts from being displayed for your product catalog. It accepts a comma separated list of layouts you wish to exclude from your product catalog. For example, [product-catalogue id=‘X’ excluded_layouts=‘Thumbnail,List’] would make your product catalog display only the "Detail" view.

To remove the layout bar from your product catalog, you can try adding the following into your "Custom CSS" box for your product catalog (where the colour matches the colour of the product catalog you are using):

‘.Blue-prod-cat-header-div {display: none;}’

= My product description gets cut off even though I have changed the max characters for my product catalog, how can I fix this? =

There is a text area labelled "Custom CSS" when you click on the product catalog that you're editing. Try adding this to it:  ‘.prod-cat-addt-details-desc-div {max-height:none;}’

= How do I remove the sidebar from my product catalog? =

You can use the attribute [sidebar=‘No'] in the product-catalogue shortcode to remove the sidebar from a product catalog.

= Why aren’t my products uploading from the spreadsheet? =

There are a number of reasons why products might not be uploading correctly.
First, make sure that you’re uploading either a .xls or .xlsx file type (not .csv).
Second, make sure that you’ve written all of your field names correctly (Name, Slug, Description, Price, Image, Category, Sub-Category, Tags), especially custom fields, which need to be exactly the same as the field name.
Third, make sure that you don’t have any columns that have been edited unintentionally (which gives an “incorrect field name” error).

= How do I get custom changes I’ve made to the product page layout or the custom fields I’ve added in the product details to display? =

On  the “Options” page the “Custom Product Page” needs to be set to “Yes” for custom layout to display.

= How do I sort the order of the products within the catalog? =

You can arrange the order of the products by dragging and dropping the products on the “Catalogue Details” page .

= How do I translate the product catalog into my language? =
A great place to start learning about how to translate a plugin is at the link below: <http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-translate-a-wordpress-plugin>

Once translated, you'll need to put the translated catalog mo- and po- files directly in the lang folder and make sure they are named properly for your localization.
If you do translate the product catalog, other users would love to have access to the files in your language. You can send them to us at Contact@EtoileWebDesign.com, and we’ll be sure they’re included in a future release.

= What is enabled in the 'Premium' version? =

The premium version includes a lot of great features including: the ability to add over 100 products, additional product images, SEO friendly product catalog URLs, product tags and custom fields for product catalog sorting, custom catalog product pages, a minimalist product catalog layout option and more!

* Super responsive tabbed layout with customizable tabs
* Drag-and-drop catalog product pages layout
* Lightbox, product inquiry form (using Contact Form 7 or WPForms) and product reviews (using <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-reviews/'>Ultimate Reviews</a>)
